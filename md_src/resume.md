# Work Experience
---

## Microsoft
Software Engineer 2\
_May 2021 - Aug 2024_

* At Azure SQL DB, worked on database internals: locking, transactions, recovery, storage.
* Worked on [Optimized Locking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/optimized-locking) (OL), a revamp of DML locking by avoiding lengthy transaction-duration row locks.
* Led the elimination of short-duration row locks, putting us on par with lock-free systems like PostgreSQL.
* Led stress testing, fixed correctness bugs, debugged core dumps and transaction logs.
* OL achieved a 40% reduction in lock memory, 35% decrease in lock escalations, and 70% reduction in lock waits.
* Gained expertise in corruption, high availability, replication, and Azure orchestration while on-call.

## Samsung
Software Engineer\
_January 2021 - May 2021_

* Explored Chromium browser internals to implement live migration of JavaScript routines across Tizen OS IoT
devices, enabling compute resource sharing.

## Indian Institute of Science
Intern\
_June 2020 - December 2020_

* Designed a clustered data pipeline using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and RabbitMQ for IUDX, an [open-source](https://github.com/datakaveri) initiative
facilitating data exchange in smart cities.

## Morgan Stanley
Summer Intern\
_May 2019 - July 2019_

* Developed a chatbot to assist engineers in monitoring DevOps pipelines and deployments.
  
## Indian Institute of Science
Summer Intern\
_May 2018 - July 2018_

* Developed [MudBoxer](https://github.com/srinskit/MudBoxer), a transparent security wrapper for ROS, by injecting a shared library to intercept C++
ROS API calls, secure passed data, and forward requests back to the original calls.

# Projects
---

### [Process Migration](https://github.com/srinskit/process-migration-system)
Designed a system for migrating processes across Linux machines using kernel modules to query execution context and virtual memory state. Enhanced knowledge of process management in Operating Systems.

### [IPoX](https://github.com/srinskit/IPoX)
Designed a framework to create network links over custom transport mediums utilizing [TUN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.8/networking/tuntap.html). IPoX, for instance, can connect a computer to the internet via a phone call. Deepened understanding of networking at the kernel level.

### [MudBoxer](https://github.com/srinskit/MudBoxer)
Designed a transparent security wrapper for the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/), by injecting a shared library to intercept C++ ROS API calls and secure messages. Built a solid foundation in compilers and linkers.
