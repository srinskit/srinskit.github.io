## Work Experience

### Microsoft
Software Engineer 2\
_May 2021 - Aug 2024_

* At Azure SQL DB, worked on database internals: locking, transactions, recovery, storage.
* Worked on [Optimized Locking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/optimized-locking), a revamp of DML locking by avoiding lengthy transaction-duration row locks.
* Achieved a 40% reduction in lock memory, 35% decrease in lock escalations, and 70% reduction in lock waits.
* Led the elimination of short-duration row locks, putting us on par with lock-free systems like PostgreSQL.
* Stressed tested, fixed assertion failures and correctness bugs, debugged core dumps and transaction logs.
* Gained expertise in corruption, high availability, replication, and Azure orchestration while on-call.

### Samsung
Software Engineer\
_January 2021 - May 2021_

* Worked on live-migrating JavaScript routines across IoT home appliances to enable compute sharing.

### Indian Institute of Science
Intern\
_June 2020 - December 2020_

* Contributed to an [open-source](https://github.com/datakaveri) project facilitating data exchange in smart cities, by developing a containerized
and clustered data pipeline using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and RabbitMQ.

### Morgan Stanley

## Projects

### [Process Migration](https://github.com/srinskit/process-migration-system)
Developed a system to migrate active user processes across Linux machines using kernel
modules to query process execution context and capture virtual memory state.

### [IPoX](https://github.com/srinskit/IPoX)
Developed a framework to create network links over custom transport mediums utilizing TUN. IPoX, for
instance, can connect a computer to the internet via a phone call.
